+      An array of physical data lane indexes. Position of an entry determines
+      the logical lane number, while the value of an entry indicates controller
+      or port mapped to this lane controllers should start by 1 as 0 indicates
+      not used or disabled lane.
+      e.g. for 2-lane bus we could have
+      "data-lanes = <1 2>;"
+      where hardware lane 0 is mapped to first controller/port and lane 1 is
+      second controller/port.
